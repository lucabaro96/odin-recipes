    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Yeast</h3></p>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Sugar</h3></p>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.
        </li>
        <li><h3>Bread Flour</h3></p>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.
        </li>
    </ul>
